## 🌟 The Vision
**Aura Forecast** isn't just a dashboard; it's a **digital organism** that reacts to the environment. We've built an intelligent interface that **"feels"** the air quality of Pakistan's major cities. 

When the air is toxic, the app glows with a hazardous **Red** warning. When it's clear, it breathes a calming **Green**. It's data visualization, reimagined.

## 🎨 Immersive Experience
This project moves beyond standard tables and charts. We introduced **"Emotive UI"**:

| **Condition** | **Theme Color** | **Vibe** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Good** � | `Emerald Green` | Fresh, deeply breathable, calm. |
| **Moderate** 🟡 | `Solar Yellow` | Cautionary, hazy sunshine. |
| **Unhealthy** 🟠 | `Burnt Orange` | Warning signs, visible smog. |
| **Hazardous** 🔴 | `Obsidian Red` | Critical alert, intense & urgent. |

> *Select a city like **Lahore** or **Islamabad**, and watch the entire application atmosphere shift instantly.*
